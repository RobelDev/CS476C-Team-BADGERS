      <h2>Project Solution</h2>

      <p>
        We envision a fast, secure, and easy to use internal social media web application. 
        This application will be similar to a video game reward system to encourage and motivate 
        State Farm® employees who are working virtually. The Skills/Knowledge Badging System would 
        allow employees to acknowledge and reward their coworkers with badges and Kudos which can be 
        shown off and redeemed for real world prizes. Our solution would fill the void of recognition 
        and social interaction that once existed in the State Farm® offices.
      </p>

                <h6> Technologies  </h6>
                <div>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <h6>Frontend - ReactJS</h6>
                        In relation to our project, React as a framework is perfect for several reasons. 
                        Its component based structure will allow us to create a single page application 
                        with little struggle. Additionally, React offers a wide enough variety of tools to 
                        support our functionality as an internal social media. Integration of badges on the 
                        front end will be simple and modular due to the embedded tools in React’s components. 
                        Also, performance optimization tools are already implemented into React’s libraries 
                        allowing for more development time rather than optimization. React also natively 
                        supports NodeJS giving our team an advantage in integrating our project’s front and 
                        back end.

                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                      <h6>Backend - (Express) NodeJS</h6>
                        We chose NodeJS since it can handle the concurrent 
                        request handling efficiently better than others including Python. If our badging system 
                        receives many requests at the same time, the incoming requests will get lined up and are 
                        executed quickly and systematically. The Node.js is also known to be highly extensible, 
                        which means that we can customize and further extend Node.js as per their requirements. 
                        Although JavaScript does not have a well equipped and robust library system in comparison 
                        to other programming languages, we could solve this problem by selecting python as a 
                        supplement since python has lots of libraries. Also all the members of our team are familiar 
                        with python and Javascript.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                      <h6>Database - MongoDB</h6>
                        We believe MongoDB is the perfect database we 
                        could use for this web application. This is because MongoDB is easy to use. MongoDB 
                        is more understandable and more clear to find what you are looking for than the other database 
                        tools. MongoDB provides authentication analytics to manage real time data, push notifications, 
                        file storage and web hosting. Moreover, MongoDB has service functions that can call with auth 
                        context from the front-end, so it can easily tell the back-end code if a user logged in.
                        Lastly MongoDb was a great choice as our team was already familiarwith the tool.

                    <li>
                      <h6>PhotoShop - Gimp</h6>
                        We believe gimp will allow us to successfully create badges to deliver to State 
                        Farm. Gimp will allow us the freedom and flexibility to design these badges with 
                        ease and since it is a free application the team will not have to spend any money 
                        from their own pocket. With the easy to learn and easy to navigate user interface, 
                        we will use Gimp to create 20+ badges all around the same State Farm theme. Since it 
                        is also open source we will be able to modify any code to better fit our needs 
                        throughout the designing of these badges. We may also use Gimp for other designs 
                        across our front end single page application such as logos, sprites, images, and more. 
                        Using this application we will be able to save a large amount of time by bypassing the 
                        learning curve of some other extensive graphic design applications while still being able 
                        to come up with quality images, badges, and logos. 
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                      <h6>Version Control - Gimp</h6>
                        We believe Github will allow us to successfully manage our code. 
                        Github’s easier deployment methods are a large factor to choose it. 
                        It is also a widely used version control with the biggest community. 
                        Github’s desktop applications also makes it easier to use and maintain 
                        our project. It is also the most preferred and used among our team members 
                        for its simplicity.

                    <li>
                      <h6>IDE - Visual Studio Code</h6>
                        The majority of our team worked in Visual Studio Code as it has a ton of extensions
                        that are easily added to the IDE that help write our code. We also went with this IDE 
                        as the majority of the team already used this for other coding projects. Although any IDE 
                        would have doen the trick.

                  <li> 
                    <h6>Interesting and Responsive GUI</h6>
                      The first component of our system is the homepage of our application. 
                      This homepage will be broken up into three parts. The first part located on 
                      the left-hand side is our tool bar where users can access all of our different 
                      components in popup modals. The next part is located in the center and it is our 
                      waterfall style feed where all badge information messages from every user is 
                      displayed. The purpose of this is to add to the social media aspect of our 
                      application making it similar to Facebook or Twitter. Our third part is located 
                      on the right-hand side and is our user badge library. Here the users can see all 
                      the badges they have earned. The goal of the homepage GUI is to allow users to 
                      have an easy to use and navigate application, so our product is more enjoyable to 
                      use.

                  <li>
                    <h6>Account System with Access Restrictions</h6>
                      The next component of our application is the user authentication system. 
                      The sole responsibility of this component is to allow users to create accounts 
                      and provide an extra layer of security by forcing users to log in to their 
                      accounts every time the application is opened. This is the only component that 
                      will be separate from the single page application as we do not want to give 
                      someone access to the application if they have not been authenticated. This 
                      component will be hosted on the frontend and will speak directly to the database 
                      to authenticate users. For more security we will be using a token authenticator. 
                      For example when a user creates a new account a random unique token will be 
                      generated for their account and every time they log in, the token will be compared 
                      to the one in the database to authenticate them.

                  <li>
                    <h6>Badge Delivery System (Send/Receive/Remove)</h6>
                      The next component of our application is the badge delivery system will be the main 
                      component of our application. Its main job is to provide badges to the user when 
                      they earn them. It is also responsible for displaying the badges earned by users 
                      in the waterfall feed. A user will be able to see their badges on the front-end on 
                      the right panel of the application, as well as the badges they can still earn. 
                      Badges can also be sent to other users depending on the badge. This part of our 
                      application will be hosted on the front-end but all the functionality will be 
                      done on the back-end which will use the database.

                    <h6>Badge printing</h6>
                      The next component of our application is the badge printing model. The goal of 
                      this component is to allow the user to access the PDF of every badge they have 
                      earned so they can download, print and display their badges in the real world. 
                      When a user chooses the badge printing model on our application the first thing 
                      that will happen is a popup with all their earned badges will appear. They will 
                      then select a badge then select the confirmation box. It will then open the badge 
                      PDF in a new window for the user to do with it as they please. This component will 
                      be hosted on the front-end and will use the back-end to parse the database for the 
                      selected badges.

                    <h6>Internal Social Currency (Kudos)</h6>
                      The next component of our application is the Kudos system. This will be a 
                      second way for users to earn rewards and recognition from our application. 
                      This will work differently from the badges in the sense that Kudos will be 
                      given out on the daily by coworkers for many different reasons. Kudos are 
                      meant to be sent for smaller accomplishments where the badges are sent for 
                      larger milestones. Our Kudos system will be responsible for the sending and 
                      receiving of Kudos to every user. It will also be responsible for the Kudos 
                      store where managers can set rewards and employees can redeem them. Like the 
                      badge delivery system, the Kudos system will be hosted on the front end of the 
                      application with all the functionality being done in the back-end with help from 
                      the database. An important detail is that each user's store will be different 
                      depending on what their team's manager sets for rewards.

                    <h6>Email Signature Integration</h6>
                      The last component of our application is the email signature generator which 
                      allows users to generate a customized email signature using their earned badges. 
                      This will provide another way for the users to show off their accomplishments. 
                      Unlike the other components, the majority of the email signature generator 
                      functionality will take place on the front end. The only back-end use will be the 
                      loading of the badges to be selected for the signature. We want to give our users 
                      customizability by allowing them to choose the font, color, and order in which 
                      they would like the parts of their signature to be displayed. Once a signature has 
                      been generated it will be available to copy as a whole and saved by the user.
